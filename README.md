# NomBook

Welcome to NomBook, an app for logging your favorite dishes from around the world!

With NomBook you can view, add, and delete entries (we're still in the early stages and will add update functionality with more funding).

## Starting NomBook

Clone this repository to your local machine. Once cloned, make sure you navigate to the root of the directory and input the following commands in your terminal:
```
npm run server
```

```
npm start
```

The app will open in a new tab in your browser.

Enjoy!
